# Computer Network Simulation

This project is a simulation of a computer network created using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates practical networking concepts, including:

- Routers, switches, and personal computers (PCs)
- Web server, DHCP server, and DNS server
- Dynamic IP assignment via DHCP
- Functional DNS resolution for networked PCs

## Features

- **DHCP Server:** Dynamically assigns IP addresses and subnet masks to PCs.
- **DNS Server:** Resolves hostnames to IP addresses within the network.
- **Web Server:** Hosts a simple web page accessible by PCs.
- **Routing and Switching:** Simulates real-world network communication between devices.

## Usage

1. Open the project file `network_simulation.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Verify device configurations.
3. Test network functionality:
   - Check IP addresses assigned to PCs via DHCP.
   - Access the web server from PCs using DNS names.
   - Ping between devices to verify connectivity.
